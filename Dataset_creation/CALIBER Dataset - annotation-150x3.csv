Setting aside the common artistic liberties taken during that historical period, and focusing exclusively on the official decree ratified by the governing body responsible for Cymru's cultural symbols at that specific point in time, what precise shade, as categorized according to the then-widely-used Ridgway's Colour Standards, would most accurately describe the color of the creature adorning the national banner that served to distinguish the land of song from its Anglo-Saxon neighbor, while acknowledging that depictions in woven tapestries frequently employed substitute dyes such as indigo?"
